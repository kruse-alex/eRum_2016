# Slides for eRum 2016
European R users meeting (eRum) was an international conference that aimed at integrating users of the R language. eRum 2016 was a good chance to exchange experiences, broaden knowledge on R and collaborate. In this Repo you can find the slides for my lightning talk on "Multidimensional Clustering of Web Analytics Data".
